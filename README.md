cloc

cloc is tiny command line application to help you keep track of when you work. 

Use cloc to help you fill out your timesheet at work, to help you divide time between projects, or simply to better understand your working habits! 

Start clocking in now
---------------------
Just `cloc in PROJECT` when you begin working on a project, then `cloc out` when you're finished. All of your work periods are stored in an easily-readable log file. Deal with the raw data yourself, or use one of cloc's options for quickly visualizing data or totalling work time.
